# About me

Hello, I'm Artem Różycki (<mark style="color:green;">ssmqd</mark>), and welcome to my blog! I’m an 18 years old student from Poland, on track to graduate in 2026. As I embark on this exciting journey, my goal is to deepen my understanding of cybersecurity, gain valuable hands-on experience, and prepare myself for a career in offensive cybersecurity. Starting in September 2024, I'll be focusing on expanding my knowledge and skills to maximize my job prospects in this field by the time I graduate. Through this blog, I’ll be documenting my progress, challenges, and learnings along the way.

To everyone reading this, I hope you're doing well and find something interesting here. If you have any thoughts or recommendations, feel free to message me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rozyckiartem/).
