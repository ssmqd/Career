## A Beginner's Journey in Cybersecurity: The CPTS Certification and HackTheBox Academy

### **Introduction**

Hi there, **Artem here!** Welcome to my blog. You can read more [about me](https://ssmqd.gitbook.io/about) in the corresponding section, but what you should know for now is that the **CPTS** was my first cybersecurity exam and my first real experience in this field. This blog post will provide insights of that journey, especially from the perspective of someone just starting out. If you're beginning your career in cybersecurity, like I was, this might give you some valuable guidance.

### Why I Chose HackTheBox Academy

My journey into cybersecurity began with the TryHackMe platform in February 2024. While TryHackMe provided a solid foundation through its basic paths, I soon realized that I needed more structured and challenging material to advance my skills. This realization led me to <mark style="color:green;">HackTheBox</mark> Academy, where I enrolled in the Penetration Tester Specialist path from March to August 2024.

### Key Benefits of HackTheBox Academy

**Structured Learning Approach**: One of <mark style="color:green;">HackTheBox</mark> Academy‚Äôs biggest strengths is its structured learning environment. The curriculum is designed so that every tool and technique is introduced methodically, ensuring that learners build on their knowledge step by step. This cohesion makes the learning experience valuable and reinforces understanding over time.

**Hands-On Practical Tasks**: Each module is broken down into subcategories that introduce new tools and techniques. To progress, you must complete practical tasks that reinforce the theoretical knowledge gained. This hands-on approach is essential for preparing for the certification exam and ensuring comprehensive understanding.

**Mandatory Completion for Certification**: To be eligible for the CPTS exam, you must complete 100% of the learning path. This requirement guarantees that aspiring penetration testers don‚Äôt miss out on any critical topics, ensuring a well-rounded skill set.

**Supportive Community**: <mark style="color:green;">HackTheBox</mark> has a vibrant community that is always ready to help. The community is structured to offer hints rather than direct answers, encouraging a deeper understanding of the subject matter and helping learners troubleshoot problems effectively.

### My Experience with HackTheBox Academy

Overall, my experience with HackTheBox was overwhelmingly positive. The structured content, supportive community, and hands-on exercises provided a solid foundation for my cybersecurity knowledge. Occasionally, I encountered issues connecting to the virtual machines, but these were infrequent and typically resolved with a VPN switch or lab restart.

## The Importance of the CPTS Certification

The CPTS certification is ideal for beginner penetration testers. It helps consolidate the knowledge gained during the <mark style="color:green;">HackTheBox</mark> path, ensuring that the skills learned are retained and applicable in real-world scenarios. To pass the CPTS exam, you need to capture at least 12 out of 14 flags, which covers a wide range of topics, including:

* Penetration testing processes and methodologies
* Information gathering and reconnaissance techniques
* Attacking both Windows and Linux targets
* Active Directory penetration testing
* Web application penetration testing
* Manual and automated exploitation
* Vulnerability assessment
* Pivoting and lateral movement
* Post-exploitation enumeration
* Privilege escalation on Windows and Linux systems

### The Reporting Challenge

Successfully capturing the required number of flags is only part of the exam. A crucial element is the exam report, which should include:

* High-level and detailed walkthroughs of your attack chain
* A comprehensive list of vulnerabilities found, their impact, and how to reproduce and discover them
* An execution summary
* A list of discovered domains, subdomains, and machines
* Cleanup steps required post-engagement

Properly documenting your findings is vital, and I underestimated this initially. After capturing my 12th flag two days before the exam's end, I took a day off, thinking the report would be a quick task. This decision led to a last-minute rush, where I spent almost 18 hours on the final day compiling all the necessary information.

### Tips for Aspiring CPTS Candidates

In my opinion, this exam requires a lot of knowledge, but with proper preparation, it won‚Äôt be a huge challenge. Relying on the Academy modules, you‚Äôll find everything you need to know to pass the exam successfully. However, I would recommend the following:

1. **Don‚Äôt Rush Through the Modules**: Take detailed notes and strive to understand every technique discussed. Supplement your learning with additional research and YouTube tutorials on specific topics.
2. **Practice Skill Assessments**: Revisit and redo the skill assessments from each module to reinforce your knowledge of the tools and techniques.
3. **Focus on the ‚ÄúAttacking Enterprise Network‚Äù Module**: This module is crucial for understanding real-world penetration testing. Complete it thoroughly, then repeat without hints, and try creating a test report. This practice will prepare you for the real exam.

## Conclusion

Starting my cybersecurity journey with <mark style="color:green;">HackTheBox</mark> Academy was a decision I‚Äôm proud of. The CPTS path is an excellent starting point for anyone looking to break into cybersecurity. It‚Äôs challenging, educational, and, above all, rewarding. For those preparing for the CPTS exam, remember to stay calm and focused‚Äîthe solution is often closer than you think. Good luck!
